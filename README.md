# Bright-AI-Homework
A collection of Machine Learning algorithms implemented using numpy in Python. The exercises were completed as part of Columbia's Machine Learning assignments.

The following algorithms have been implemented:

1. Ridge Regression (hw1)
2. Logistic Regression (hw2)
3. K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier (hw2)
4. Naive Bayes Classifier (hw2)
5. Gaussian Process for Regression (hw3)
6. Gradient Boosted Linear Classifier (hw3)
7. K-Means Clustering (hw4)
8. Matrix Factorization (hw4)
9. Markov Chain (hw5)
10. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (hw5)
